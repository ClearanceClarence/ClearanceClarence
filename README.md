# Hi, I’m CC 👋
**Senior Full Stack Developer | PHP • WordPress • REST APIs • CMS Architecture**

I build high-performance web platforms, custom CMS solutions, and backend systems with a strong focus on clean architecture, maintainability, and real-world production reliability.

By trade I work primarily with PHP and WordPress at scale.  
By curiosity I enjoy building systems from scratch to better understand fundamentals, performance tradeoffs, and architecture decisions.

## 🚀 Featured Project

### 🧩 VoidForge CMS
A lightweight content management system built entirely in pure PHP as a personal engineering challenge — no frameworks, no dependencies.

**Highlights**
- ~350KB total footprint  
- Sub-50ms page loads (no caching)  
- Plugin architecture with WordPress-style hooks  
- REST API for headless usage  
- Role-based security model  
- Clean, readable codebase  

This project exists to explore architecture, performance, and developer ergonomics — not as a commercial product.
